# Embedded-Spatial-Measurement-System
Designed a device which uses a rotary mechanism to provide a 360Â° measurement of distance within a single geometric vertical plane. The C code drives the MSP-Y Board for the rotary motion and sends the measured distances to the serial stream. The python code receives info from the serial stream and creates a 3D visualization of the measured data. For more information refer to the Documentation.pdf file. 

Note: The C code is MUCH bigger than the Python code which is why python code is detected as "other".
